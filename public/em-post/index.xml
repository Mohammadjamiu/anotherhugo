      <description>NB: This post contains free downloadable files and affliate links to some books - which means TA might get acommission as you engage but, at no extra cost to you.In this post, I would be listing out the resources to help you self-learn electromagnetics fieldtheory from scratch and these resources are what I’ve came across over the years as an electricalengineering student trying to desperately learn electromagnetics field theory because, to be frankwith you it’s a difficult but interesting course.</description>

      <description>As an electrical engineering student, we all have that one course that frightens us and one of them is electromagnetics field theory sometimes called engineering electromagnetics.
In this section, I would discuss why it is difficult to learn and understand electromagnetics field theory and then proceed to how we can grasp the concepts using some techniques and tips.
Why is electromagnetics field theory difficult to learn? It is difficult to learn because, it is full of abstractions (meaning concepts that can’t be seen physically with the naked eye except by imagination, experience or by accident) for example an electric field or a magnetic field.</description>
