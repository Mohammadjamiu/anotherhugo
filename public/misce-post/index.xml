      <description>NB: This post contains some affliate links - which means TA might get acommission as you subscribe but, at no extra cost to you.This post is among the series of post tagged “4 years of college shouldn’t be a waste of time” wherewe discussed about how to be productive, have better grades and even develop skills that payoff onthe long run.Without doubt, we all know that engineering is an interesting but a complex field to study and mosttimes, it is due to the fact that the standard we are being taught with is quite outdated or notthat useful in the industry or the world we are in today.</description>
